# Processing Sketches

## Background

One of my first entrypoints to programming was in 2013 when I learned about Processing software in an Arduino course I took in college. I fell in love with Processing because it brought together software and art in a way that made sense to me. I loved writing lines of coding and having them appear visually on the screen. This repository includes a couple of my old projects.
